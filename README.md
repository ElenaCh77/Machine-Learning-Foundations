# Machine-Learning-Foundations
Labs by Cornell Tech (Break Through Tech AI Program). The course focused on building ethical, real-world ML models using Python, covering the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. These labs include hands-on work with real datasets, exploring core ML concepts such as regression, classification, and bias evaluation.

Lab 1 – Airbnb Listings Data
```
In this lab, I worked with the Airbnb “Listings” dataset, which contains New York City Airbnb data from December 2021 (modified for the Break Through Tech AI program).
The objective was to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to identify patterns and prepare the data for future machine learning tasks.
